# A Complete Guide to Modern Blog Writing

Welcome to this comprehensive guide that demonstrates various content types and styling options available for your blog posts. This post will show you how to create rich, engaging content using different markdown elements.

## Basic Typography

Regular paragraphs are the foundation of any blog post. They should be clear and readable, with proper spacing and line height. Here's an example of a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text***.

You can also use [links to other pages](https://example.com) and create `inline code` snippets.

## Lists and Structure

### Unordered Lists

Here's an example of an unordered list:

- First item with some explanation
- Second item that's also important
- Third item with additional details
  - Nested item one
  - Nested item two

### Ordered Lists

And here's an ordered list:

1. First step in the process
2. Second step to follow
3. Final step to complete
   1. Sub-step one
   2. Sub-step two

## Code Blocks

Here are examples of code blocks in different languages:

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function calculateFactorial(n) {
    if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    return n * calculateFactorial(n - 1);
}

// Calculate factorial of 5
console.log(calculateFactorial(5)); // Output: 120
```

### Python Example

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        sequence.append(sequence[-1] + sequence[-2])
    
    return sequence

# Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

## Blockquotes

Here's how to use blockquotes for highlighting important information:

> "The art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe."
> â€” Gustave Flaubert

You can also use blockquotes for highlighting important information or creating callouts:

> **Note:** This is a special note that deserves attention.
> 
> It can contain multiple paragraphs and other elements.

## Tables

Tables are great for organizing and comparing data:

| Feature | Basic Plan | Pro Plan | Enterprise Plan |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Storage | 10GB | 100GB | Unlimited |
| Users | 1-5 | 5-20 | Unlimited |
| Support | Email | Priority | 24/7 Dedicated |
| Price | $10/mo | $25/mo | Custom |

## Images

Images can be included with captions:

## Special Callouts

<div class="callout">
<div class="callout-title">ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip</div>
<p>Use callouts to highlight important information, tips, or warnings in your blog posts. They help break up the content and draw attention to key points.</p>
</div>

## Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules to separate different sections of your content:

## Mathematical Expressions

You can include mathematical expressions using LaTeX syntax:

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$

## Tags

<div class="blog-tags">
    <a href="#" class="blog-tag">markdown</a>
    <a href="#" class="blog-tag">tutorial</a>
    <a href="#" class="blog-tag">styling</a>
</div>

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates the various content types and styling options available for your blog posts. Use these elements to create engaging, well-structured content that's easy to read and visually appealing.

Remember to:
- Use appropriate headings for structure
- Include code blocks with syntax highlighting
